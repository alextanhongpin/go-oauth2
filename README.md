Exploring different authorization mechanism between microservices.

### JWS

JWS authentication works by using a JSON Web Token (JWT) to represent the claims about a user or other entity. The JWT is signed with a private key, and the public key is used to verify the signature.

In the context of microservices, the private key is typically held by the microservice that is issuing the JWT, and the public key is typically held by the microservice that is validating the JWT.

Here is an example of how JWS authentication works for microservices:

1. The user logs in to the first microservice.
2. The first microservice issues a JWT that contains the user's claims.
3. The JWT is signed with the first microservice's private key.
4. The JWT is sent to the second microservice.
5. The second microservice validates the JWT using the first microservice's public key.
6. If the JWT is valid, the second microservice grants access to the user.
JWS authentication is a secure way to authenticate microservice-to-microservice communication. The use of private and public keys ensures that only the intended recipient can verify the JWT.

Here are some additional considerations for using JWS authentication for microservices:

- Security: JWS authentication is a secure way to authenticate microservice-to-microservice communication. The use of private and public keys ensures that only the intended recipient can verify the JWT.
- Ease of use: JWS authentication is relatively easy to implement. There are a number of libraries available that make it easy to generate and verify JWTs.
- Scalability: JWS authentication is scalable. It can be used to authenticate microservice-to-microservice communication in large and complex applications.
- Cost: JWS authentication is relatively inexpensive. There are no licensing fees or other costs associated with using JWS authentication.
Overall, JWS authentication is a secure, easy to use, and scalable way to authenticate microservice-to-microservice communication.
